# Planets Table üåç 

This is a static HTML table displaying data about the planets in our solar system. The project was created to demonstrate skills in building semantic and accessible table layouts using HTML, and applying styles with CSS. [ [Live Demo](https://codamee.github.io/Planets-Tabular-Data/) ]

## Key Features:
-   **Semantic HTML:** Uses `<caption>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>` for proper structure.
-   **Advanced Layout:** Leverages `colspan` and `rowspan` to create a complex table.
-   **Styling:** Utilizes the `<colgroup>` and `<col>` elements for efficient column-based styling.
-   **Accessibility:** Includes the `scope` attribute on `<th>` elements to improve accessibility for screen readers.
